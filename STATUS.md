## Section 1 — Project Scaffold
**Completed:** 2026-06-22T00:00:00Z
**Commit:** `init: scaffold Sarjapur project with TypeScript and package.json`

### What was done
- Created `C:\dev\Sarjapur` and initialized git repo with remote `https://github.com/brijbh/sarjapur.git`
- `.gitignore` — node_modules, dist, *.js.map, .env, misc
- `package.json` — name `local-ai`, v0.1.0, ESM, bin → `./dist/cli.js`, deps include `llm-env-check@latest`
- `tsconfig.json` — ES2022 / NodeNext / strict / declarations + sourcemaps, outDir `dist`, rootDir `src`
- `npm install` succeeded — 148 packages, 4 vulnerabilities reported (3 low, 1 high); not addressed in v0.1 scaffold
- All empty source files created with `// TODO: implement`:
  - `src/commands/{doctor,setup,status,repair,reset,cleanup}.ts`
  - `src/core/{scanner,envcheck,advisor,state,permissions,paths,workflow}.ts`
  - `src/providers/lmstudio.ts`
  - `src/integrations/{opencode,vscode}.ts`
  - `src/utils/{command,files,format,json}.ts`
- `src/cli.ts` — minimal commander entry registering `--version` (0.1.0), `--help`, and welcome banner on no-args
- `npm run typecheck` — passes with zero errors

### llm-env-check inspection (Task 1.7)
Installed version: **1.0.0**

Package metadata:
- `"type": "commonjs"`
- `"main": "dist/index.js"`
- `"types": "dist/index.d.ts"`
- `"bin": { "llm-env-check": "dist/cli.js" }`

It exposes **both** a programmatic API and a CLI. Key exports from `dist/index.d.ts`:

```ts
export { detectSystem } from "./system/detect";          // () => SystemInfo  (sync)
export { recommendModels } from "./recommend/models";
export { recommendRuntimes } from "./recommend/runtimes";
export declare function createReport(profile: Profile, system?: SystemInfo): ScanReport;
export * from "./types";
```

`SystemInfo` shape (from `types.d.ts`):
```ts
interface SystemInfo {
  osName: string;
  osVersion: string;
  cpuModel?: string;
  cpuArchitecture: string;
  totalRamGb: number;
  freeRamGb: number;
  gpuName?: string;
  vramGb?: number;
  nodeVersion: string;
  runtimes: RuntimeDetection[];
}
```

**Implication for Section 2:** use **Strategy A — programmatic API**. `envcheck.ts` will import `detectSystem` directly, map `SystemInfo` → `HardwareCapabilities`, and derive `runnableModelTiers` from RAM/VRAM via the table in the prompt (llm-env-check does not return tier data directly — it returns model-by-model `recommendModels` results instead). GPU `accelerationAvailable` will be inferred from `gpuName` presence + platform (no explicit field in llm-env-check).

### Known gaps or deferred items
- npm audit reported 4 vulnerabilities (3 low, 1 high); not addressed in scaffold — revisit before publish.
- `dist/` not built yet — will build in Section 5 (CLI skeleton) per the prompt's first-build-required gate.
- `docs/` directory not created — deferred to Section 11.
- `README.md` not created — deferred to Section 11.

## Section 2 — llm-env-check Integration and Scanner
**Completed:** 2026-06-22T13:09:00Z
**Commit:** `feat: implement llm-env-check integration and scanner module`

### What was done
- `src/core/envcheck.ts` — **Strategy A (programmatic API)** used. Imports `detectSystem` from `llm-env-check` directly (it is a sync function returning `SystemInfo`). Maps `SystemInfo` → `HardwareCapabilities`. Derives `runnableModelTiers` from the RAM/VRAM table in the prompt (llm-env-check does not return tier data). Infers GPU acceleration type (CUDA/Metal/Vulkan/ROCm) from `gpuName` string matching. Exports `getHardwareCapabilities(): Promise<HardwareCapabilities>` and `ModelTier` type.
- `src/core/paths.ts` — all path constants: `STATE_DIR`, `STATE_FILE`, `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, `OPENCODE_CONFIG_FILE`, `LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL`, `LMSTUDIO_MODELS_ENDPOINT`, `LMSTUDIO_MODEL_DIRS`.
- `src/core/scanner.ts` — `CheckStatus`, `CheckResult`, `ModelCheckResult`, `ScanResult` types defined and exported. Implements: `checkOS()`, `checkArch()`, `checkNode()`, `checkNpm()`, `checkGit()`, `checkWinget()`, `checkOpencode()`, `checkVSCode()`, `checkStateFile()`, `checkOpencodeConfig()`. `runScan()` calls `getHardwareCapabilities()` first, then runs all other checks in parallel via `Promise.all()`. `lmstudio` and `models` fields are stubs — populated in Section 3.
- `src/utils/command.ts` — `runCommand(cmd, args): Promise<string | null>` and `commandExists(cmd): Promise<boolean>` implemented using `execa` with 5-second timeout; never throws.
- `npm run typecheck` — passes with zero errors.

### llm-env-check invocation strategy
Strategy A — programmatic import. `detectSystem()` is synchronous; wrapped in an `async` function for interface consistency. VRAM tier logic and GPU acceleration type are derived internally since `llm-env-check` v1.0.0 does not expose those fields directly.

### Known gaps or deferred items
- `lmstudio` and `models` fields in `runScan()` are intentional stubs — wired up in Section 3.
- `SARJAPUR_AGENT_PROMPT.md` is untracked in git (not in `.gitignore`); included in this commit as project specification.

---

## Section 3 — LM Studio Provider and Model Filtering
**Completed:** 2026-06-22T13:16:00Z
**Commit:** `feat: implement LM Studio provider detection and model filtering`

### What was done
- `src/providers/lmstudio.ts` — fully implemented:
  - **Task 3.1** — `fetchModelsRaw()`: HTTP GET to `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/models` with 3-second `AbortController` timeout. Never throws — returns `{ ok, reason }` union. Handles ECONNREFUSED, abort, and non-200 responses.
  - **Task 3.2** — Zod schemas: `LMStudioModelSchema` (id, object, owned_by) and `LMStudioModelsResponseSchema` (data array + object). Schema mismatch returns `status: 'warn'` with parse error detail.
  - **Task 3.3** — `filterCompatibleModels(modelIds, hardware)`: parses parameter size from model IDs via regex (1B–70B+), cross-references against `hardware.runnableModelTiers`. Unknown sizes are included. If no models survive filtering, all models returned.
  - **Task 3.4** — `selectPreferredModel(modelIds, hardware)`: applies 5-tier preference rules (qwen3-coder > qwen3 > qwen > coder > code). Among ties, picks the largest runnable tier. Returns `null` if no rule matches.
  - **Task 3.5** — `checkLMStudio(hardware)`: orchestrates server check + model list + filtering + selection. Returns `{ server: CheckResult, models: ModelCheckResult }`.
- `src/core/scanner.ts` — **Task 3.6**: imported `checkLMStudio` and wired into `runScan()` via `Promise.all`. Removed Section 3 stubs. `lmstudio` and `models` fields now populated from live LM Studio server.
- `npm run typecheck` — passes with zero errors.

### Known gaps or deferred items
- `checkLMStudio()` is exported independently so Section 7 (setup workflow) can re-scan LM Studio after user installs a model, without re-running the full scan.

---

## Section 4 — Core Modules
**Completed:** 2026-06-22T13:22:00Z
**Commit:** `feat: implement advisor, state, permissions, and utility modules`

### What was done
- `src/core/advisor.ts` — `Advice` interface + `buildAdvice(scan)`: derives `missingTools` from scan statuses, `compatibleModels`/`preferredModel` from models check, `hardwareSummary` in plain English, ordered `recommendations` (most blocking first), and `isSetupComplete` flag (true only if state + opencode config + LM Studio + models are all `ok`).
- `src/core/state.ts` — `StateSchema` (Zod), `State` type. `readState()` returns `null` if missing/invalid. `writeState()` is atomic (writes to `.tmp` then renames). `clearState()` deletes state file only, ignores ENOENT.
- `src/core/permissions.ts` — `ask()` (Yes/No via `@inquirer/prompts confirm`), `strongConfirm()` (user must type exact word), `choose<T>()` (select list). All handle Ctrl+C: exit 0, print `Cancelled.`
- `src/utils/format.ts` — `printHeader`, `printCheckResult` (✓/⚠/✗ with chalk colours), `printSuccess`, `printWarn`, `printError`, `printInfo`, `printSection`, `printHardwareSummary`, `printVSCodeCard` (exact next-steps card text from the prompt).
- `src/utils/files.ts` — `fileExists`, `readJsonFile<T>`, `writeJsonFile` (mkdir recursive), `backupFile` (timestamped `YYYYMMDD-HHMM` in local time, throws if source missing), `getFolderSize` (recursive bytes, skips unreadable).
- `src/utils/json.ts` — `safeParseJson<T>(schema, raw)` — JSON.parse + Zod safeParse, returns null on any failure.
- `src/core/workflow.ts` — stub: exports `WorkflowTarget` type and `runSetupWorkflow()` signature. Logs `[not yet implemented]`. Full implementation in Section 7.
- `npm run typecheck` — passes with zero errors.

### Known gaps or deferred items
- `workflow.ts` is a stub — Section 7 implements terminal, VS Code, and both flows.
- `advisor.ts` sets `preferredWorkflow: null` — this is populated after the user chooses a workflow in the setup command (Section 7).

---

## Section 5 — CLI Entry Point and Command Skeletons
**Completed:** 2026-06-22T13:28:00Z
**Commit:** `feat: implement CLI entry point and command skeletons`

### What was done
- `src/cli.ts` — full commander entry point: name `local-ai`, description + author, version `0.1.0`. Imports and registers all 6 commands. Default action (no subcommand) calls `runSetup()`.
- `src/commands/doctor.ts` — `register()` + `runDoctor()` stub (prints `[not yet implemented]`).
- `src/commands/setup.ts` — `register()` + `runSetup()` stub.
- `src/commands/status.ts` — `register()` + `runStatus()` stub.
- `src/commands/repair.ts` — `register()` + `runRepair()` stub.
- `src/commands/reset.ts` — `register()` + `runReset()` stub.
- `src/commands/cleanup.ts` — `register()` + `runCleanup()` stub (includes `--delete` option stub).
- `npm run typecheck` — passes with zero errors.
- `npm run build` — passes with zero errors. `dist/` generated.
- `node dist/cli.js --help` — verified: all 6 commands listed with correct descriptions.

### Known gaps or deferred items
- All `run*()` functions are stubs — implemented in Sections 6, 7, 9, 10.
- `dist/` is git-ignored as per `.gitignore`.

---

## Section 6 — Doctor and Status Commands
**Completed:** 2026-06-22T13:41:00Z
**Commit:** `feat: implement doctor and status commands`

### What was done
- `src/commands/doctor.ts` — fully implemented `runDoctor()`:
  - Prints welcome banner via `printHeader()`.
  - Calls `runScan()` then `buildAdvice()`.
  - Prints hardware summary (`printHardwareSummary`), then check results grouped into sections: System, Local AI Runtime (with per-model list showing `← recommended`), Coding Tools, Saved Setup.
  - Prints ordered recommendations from `buildAdvice()`.
  - Exits `0` if all checks pass; exits `1` if any check is `warn`, `missing`, or `error`.
- `src/commands/status.ts` — fully implemented `runStatus()`:
  - Reads state file via `readState()`. If missing: prints error + `Run: local-ai setup` → exits 1.
  - Prints saved state (profile, workflow, provider, server, model, config path, last verified).
  - Runs live verification: `checkLMStudio()` (server + model availability by ID), `checkOpencodeConfig()`.
  - If all pass: updates `lastVerified` timestamp in state file atomically, prints `Local AI is ready.` + `Next command: opencode` → exits 0.
  - If any fail: prints `Run: local-ai repair` → exits 1.
- `npm run typecheck` — zero errors.
- `npm run build` — zero errors.

### Known gaps or deferred items
- **Cosmetic — banner doubles the author tagline.** `runDoctor`/`runStatus` call `printHeader('Developed by Brijesh B')`, but `printHeader` ([utils/format.ts:22-23](src/utils/format.ts:22)) already emits the tagline on its own line. Result: `Welcome to local-ai  —  Developed by Brijesh B` immediately followed by `Developed by Brijesh B`. Fix: pass an empty title or change `printHeader` to omit the em-dash when title is empty.
- **Cosmetic — LM Studio label drift.** Scanner labels the check `LM Studio`; the prompt's reference doctor output shows `LM Studio server reachable`. Functionally identical; only the on-screen label differs.
- Doctor and status verified end-to-end on the dev machine (RTX 5060 Laptop GPU, 31.3 GB RAM, LM Studio reachable, opencode 1.14.41 installed). `status` exits 1 with `No setup found.` as expected; `doctor` exits 1 because state file is missing.

---

## Section 7 — Setup Command and Workflow Orchestration
**Completed:** 2026-06-22T14:48:00Z
**Commit:** `feat: implement setup command and workflow orchestration`

### What was done
- `src/commands/setup.ts` — full `runSetup()` (Task 7.1): prints banner via `printHeader('Setup')` (avoids the Section 6 banner-duplication issue), runs `runScan()` + `buildAdvice()`, prints hardware + grouped checks, exits 0 with "already set up" message when `advice.isSetupComplete`, lists compatible models with `← recommended` tag, asks workflow target via `choose<WorkflowTarget>(['terminal','vscode','both'])`, then delegates to `runSetupWorkflow()`.
- `src/core/workflow.ts` — full orchestrator replacing the Section 4 stub:
  - **Task 7.2 — installation phase.** `installMissingTools(scan, advice)` runs three sub-installers in order. Each gates on `scan.<tool>.status !== 'ok'` and `ask()` permission. winget availability is re-checked before each winget call; if missing, prints a manual download URL. Git → `winget install --id Git.Git`. LM Studio tries `ElementLabs.LMStudio`, `LMStudio.LMStudio`, `lmstudio` in order until one succeeds (since the prompt's Appendix C flags the ID as needing verification). opencode → `npm install -g opencode`. After LM Studio install: prints download steps for `advice.preferredModel`, then `waitForUserReady()` (Enter to continue, `S` to skip).
  - **Task 7.3 — terminal flow.** `runTerminalSetup` verifies opencode, LM Studio, and a loaded model; calls `ensureOpencodeConfig()` (only writes if missing or user approves merge); calls `saveStateIfApproved('terminal', model, profile)`; prints "Terminal workflow ready" + `Next command: opencode`; optionally spawns `cmd /c start powershell -NoExit -Command "Set-Location '<cwd>'; opencode"` via `launchOpencode()` with detached + unref.
  - **Task 7.4 — VS Code flow.** `runVSCodeSetup` reuses `ensureOpencodeConfig` + `saveStateIfApproved`, then `printVSCodeCard(model)` (the exact card text from `utils/format.ts`), then optionally `launchVSCode(cwd)` via `spawn('code', [cwd], { shell: true, detached: true })`. If `code` is missing, prints the install instructions and continues — the user can still use opencode inside VS Code's terminal.
  - **Task 7.5 — both flow.** Single config write + single state save (no duplication), then both launch prompts.
  - LM Studio is re-scanned via `checkLMStudio(hardware)` after the install phase so the workflow sees a freshly-loaded model without a full `runScan()`.
  - Model resolution: prefers `models.selectedModel` → `advice.preferredModel` → `choose()` from compatible model IDs → bail with a warning if none.
- `src/integrations/opencode.ts` — implemented (pulled forward from Section 8 as Section 7 depends on it):
  - `generateOpencodeConfig(modelId)` — Task 8.1 — emits the `$schema` + `provider.lmstudio` block with `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`, `baseURL: http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1`, and the model entry keyed by the raw LM Studio ID with a derived human name (kebab → Title Case + " (local)").
  - `mergeOpencodeConfig(existing, generated)` — Task 8.2 — only touches `provider.lmstudio`; preserves existing `$schema`, other providers, and existing lmstudio fields; deep-merges `models` with existing winning on key conflict.
  - `writeOpencodeConfig(modelId)` — Task 8.3 — if config exists: asks via `ask()`, backs up via `backupFile()` (timestamped `YYYYMMDD-HHMM` per Section 4), then merges and writes. If no consent: prints the would-be config and returns `written: false`. If no existing config: writes fresh. Returns `{ backedUp, backupPath, written }`.
  - `checkOpencodeInstalled()` and `checkOpencodeConfigFile()` — Task 8.4 — added (the existing `checkOpencodeConfig` in `scanner.ts` is the scanner-level variant; this returns the `{ exists, path, valid }` shape the prompt specifies for Section 8).
  - `launchOpencode(cwd)` — Task 8.5 — Windows path: `cmd /c start "" powershell -NoExit -Command "Set-Location '<cwd>'; opencode"` (the empty `""` is the Windows-`start` window title slot, prevents the cwd being mis-parsed as the title). Non-Windows fallback. On failure: prints `cd <cwd>` + `opencode` manual instructions.
- `src/integrations/vscode.ts` — `checkVSCodeInstalled()` + `launchVSCode(cwd)` (spawn `code <cwd>` with `shell: true` since `code` is a .cmd on Windows; detached + unref).
- `npm run typecheck` — zero errors.
- `npm run build` — zero errors.
- `node dist/cli.js --help` — confirms `setup` is registered with the correct description.

### VS Code launch test result
Not executed end-to-end during this section: running `setup` would prompt for installs and write `%USERPROFILE%\.local-ai\state.json` + `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\opencode.json`, both of which are gated by `ask()` at runtime per the prompt's permission model. The build passes, all command surfaces exist, and the launch helpers (`launchOpencode`, `launchVSCode`) use the documented Windows patterns. End-to-end verification deferred to the user / a later integration test.

### Known gaps or deferred items
- **LM Studio winget ID is a best-effort try-list** (`ElementLabs.LMStudio`, `LMStudio.LMStudio`, `lmstudio`). Per Appendix C of the prompt this needs `winget search lmstudio` verification on a real machine. Loop tries each until one succeeds; falls back to printing the manual download URL.
- **opencode integration was pulled forward from Section 8** because Section 7's terminal/VS Code flows directly call `writeOpencodeConfig()` and `launchOpencode()`. Section 8 will validate the implementation and add any missing surface area (no further work expected beyond verification).
- **No end-to-end run of `local-ai setup`** during this section — see "VS Code launch test result" above.
- `Profile` is hardcoded to `'coding'` for v0.1 (matches `llm-env-check`'s default profile for coding tools).

---

## Section 8 — opencode Integration
**Completed:** 2026-06-22T15:12:00Z
**Commit:** `feat: implement opencode config generation, merge, and backup`

### What was done
Most of Section 8's surface was pulled forward into Section 7 (because the workflow flows directly call `writeOpencodeConfig` / `launchOpencode`). This section verifies the implementation and closes two spec gaps:

- **Rename: `checkOpencodeConfigFile` → `checkOpencodeConfig`** ([integrations/opencode.ts](src/integrations/opencode.ts)) to match Task 8.4's exact signature `Promise<{ exists, path, valid }>`. No callers existed, so the rename was safe. Note: `scanner.ts` also exports a `checkOpencodeConfig` returning `Promise<CheckResult>` — different module, different return type; consumers import by module path.
- **Fix: human-name derivation now matches Appendix B exactly.** Previous implementation used `charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slice(1)` which left `30b` and `a3b` lowercase on the trailing `b`. New `titleCaseSegment()` capitalizes the first letter of each hyphen segment AND any letter immediately following a digit. Verified end-to-end against Appendix B's literal example:
  - Input: `qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct`
  - Output: `Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct (local)` — matches Appendix B exactly.
- **Merge logic verified in-memory** against all four spec rules (no file writes). Confirmed via inline node script:
  - `$schema` preserved if existing — PASS
  - Top-level user keys preserved (`someUserSetting: 42`) — PASS
  - Other providers untouched (`provider.openai.models['gpt-4']`) — PASS
  - Existing lmstudio model entries preserved (`legacy-old-model`) while new model added (`qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct`) — PASS

### Task coverage (audit)
| Task | Implemented in | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 8.1 — `generateOpencodeConfig(modelId)` | Section 7 + Appendix B fix here | ✓ |
| 8.2 — `mergeOpencodeConfig(existing, generated)` | Section 7 | ✓ (verified) |
| 8.3 — `writeOpencodeConfig(modelId)` with backup + merge flow | Section 7 | ✓ |
| 8.4 — `checkOpencodeInstalled()` + `checkOpencodeConfig()` | Section 7 + rename here | ✓ |
| 8.5 — `launchOpencode(cwd)` Windows spawn | Section 7 | ✓ |
| 8.6 — typecheck + build | Here | ✓ — zero errors |

### Known gaps or deferred items
- No end-to-end run of `writeOpencodeConfig` against the real `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\opencode.json` — gated on user consent at runtime, not exercised during the build.

---

## Section 9 — Repair and Reset Commands
**Completed:** 2026-06-22T15:29:00Z
**Commit:** `feat: implement repair and reset commands`

### What was done
- `src/commands/repair.ts` — full `runRepair()` (Task 9.1):
  - Reads state via `readState()`. If missing → prints `No saved setup found.` + `Run: local-ai setup` → exits 1.
  - Prints the saved state (model / workflow / serverUrl / configPath / lastVerified).
  - Live verification via `checkLMStudio(hardware)`:
    - Server unreachable → exit 1 with instruction to start LM Studio.
    - No models loaded → exit 1 with instruction to load a model.
    - Saved model ID not in `/v1/models` → list available models, propose a replacement (prefers `selectedModel` → first compatible → first available), ask consent to swap.
  - `checkOpencodeConfig()`:
    - Missing → ask to recreate (calls `writeOpencodeConfig`).
    - Exists but invalid JSON → ask to back-up-and-rewrite.
    - Valid but model changed during this repair → ask to update config to the new model.
    - Valid and unchanged → success.
  - Final re-verification: LM Studio reachable + active model loaded + opencode config exists + valid. If any fails → exit 1.
  - On success: atomic state write with new `model` (if swapped) and fresh `lastVerified` (ISO 8601 UTC). Prints `Setup verified and state updated.` + `Next command: opencode` → exits 0.
- `src/commands/reset.ts` — full `runReset()` (Task 9.2):
  - Prints scope warning ("opencode config and installed tools are not affected").
  - `ask()` confirmation. If declined: prints `Reset cancelled.` → exits 0.
  - On approval: `clearState()` (already ignores ENOENT) → prints `State cleared.` + `Run: local-ai setup to start fresh.` → exits 0.
- `npm run typecheck` — zero errors.
- `npm run build` — zero errors.
- `node dist/cli.js repair` (no state file) verified: exits 1 as spec'd.

### Known gaps or deferred items
- `repair` does not re-install missing base tools (Git, LM Studio, opencode). That is `setup`'s job. If the user has uninstalled opencode after setup, `repair` will detect the missing config but not the missing binary — running `setup` again is the documented path.
- `reset` is a single-tier confirmation (Yes/No). The prompt's permission model reserves `strongConfirm` for "Overwriting an existing config file / Deleting any file / Modifying anything outside the state/config paths". The state file is **inside** the state path so single-tier `ask()` is correct per the safety policy.

---

## Section 10 — Cleanup Command
**Completed:** 2026-06-22T16:15:00Z
**Commit:** `feat: implement cleanup command in list-only mode`

### What was done
- `src/commands/cleanup.ts` — full `runCleanup(opts)`:
  - **Task 10.2** — `--delete` early exit prints `Model deletion is not available in v0.1. / To remove models: use LM Studio → My Models → Delete.` → exits 0.
  - **Task 10.1** — list mode:
    - Iterates both `LMSTUDIO_MODEL_DIRS` from [paths.ts](src/core/paths.ts): `%USERPROFILE%\.lmstudio\models` and `%USERPROFILE%\.lmstudio\hub\models`.
    - Skips directories that don't exist; tracks whether *any* directory was found.
    - For each existing directory: lists immediate subdirectories and computes recursive size via `getFolderSize()`.
    - Sorts entries descending by size. Renders an aligned 3-column table: index + name + human-readable size + full path (`B` / `KB` / `MB` / `GB` formatter inline).
    - If no model directories exist at all: prints both candidate paths + a hint to check `Settings → Model Directory` in LM Studio.
    - If directories exist but contain nothing: prints `No model files found in LM Studio directories.`
- `npm run typecheck` — zero errors.
- `npm run build` — zero errors.
- `node dist/cli.js cleanup` verified on dev machine: found `lmstudio-community` (17.4 GB) at `C:\Users\Brijesh\.lmstudio\models\lmstudio-community`, exits 0.
- `node dist/cli.js cleanup --delete` verified: prints stub message, exits 0.

### Known gaps or deferred items
- Listing groups by *top-level* subdirectory of each model dir (e.g. `lmstudio-community` rather than the individual GGUF folders inside it). Deeper drill-down is deferred to v0.2 when deletion lands and per-model granularity matters.
- v0.1 does not implement deletion. Stubbed per spec.

---

## Section 11 — Documentation
**Completed:** 2026-06-22T17:45:00Z
**Commit:** `docs: add README and documentation files`

### What was done
- `README.md` (134 lines) — what `local-ai` does and doesn't do, how it works, the `npx local-ai` Node prerequisite, v0.1 supported stack, full commands table, three-tier safety summary, terminal and VS Code workflows, "how to test VS Code" checklist, no-API-key note, footer.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (137 lines) — two-layer scanner / setup-assistant design with ASCII diagram, `llm-env-check` wrapper rationale, hardware-to-recommendation data flow, state file shape + why live-verified on every run, opencode merge strategy rules, extension points for v0.2+.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` (49 lines) — v0.1 (current), v0.2 (Ollama + macOS + cleanup deletion), v0.3 (llama.cpp + Aider/Continue CLI + Linux + non-interactive flags), future ideas, explicit non-goals.
- `docs/SAFETY.md` (127 lines) — three-tier permission model with concrete examples, backup naming convention, what `local-ai` never does, exact audit paths, full manual undo procedure, "verify live every run" rationale.
- `docs/UX.md` (110 lines) — core principle ("Check automatically. Ask before changes. Explain manual fallback. Do not repeat completed setup."), canonical 10-step journey, VS Code workflow testing checklist, error-state table, exit-code table, Ctrl+C handling.

Every document ends with `*Developed by Brijesh B*` per spec.

### Known gaps or deferred items
- None. Documentation is complete to v0.1 scope. The README does not include a license badge or installation-from-npm instructions because v0.1 is not yet published to npm — those land with the v0.1 release commit.
